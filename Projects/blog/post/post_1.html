			<p id="post-text">Kids On Computers (KOC) is a non-profit all-volunteer organization. They set up computer labs in low-income schools using donated or new equipment bought through donations. The equipment contains free open source software and educational content that can be accessed without internet. KOC also sets up computer labs that can be used to teach software development, but their goal is aimed at teaching traditional academics. </p>
			<p id="post-text">
Kids On Computers receives cash donations which helps them purchase equipment. The cash donation goes to their general fund. Through that fund they purchase computer parts to upgrade or refurbish computers that have been donated. They accept laptops, peripherals, and hardware. KOC pays for shipping and handling of wherever the donor delivers the equipment as well as to where the equipment is headed. KOC has purchased some computes for use in the states. Sometimes they encounter shipping complications, or customs at a host country. They rather use the fund money to buy equipment within the host country.

They are partnered with Linux Foundation and Choice Humanitarian. The Linux Foundation and KCO issued a press release statement on April 2016 announcing their partnership. CHOICE Humanitarian has worked in rural villages and with KOC they support setting up computer labs in rural schools. KCO has been awarded grants, received cash, and hardware from Hewlett-Packard, Free Geek, Yahoo, HP, and Micron Technology Inc. They are always looking for volunteers and always looking to work with other organizations that share the same goal. 
Kids On Computers has 20 current labs in Argentina, Cambodia, India, Mexico and Nepal. On their website you can learn more about each lab in that country. KCO gets lots of request, but is unable to take all of them. They have a checklist that helps them make a choice. Schools that have fill the checklist get answered, but a major influence is community support.

KOC is an organization that surprised me the most. They accomplish a lot, and they are making an impact within the gap of open source education in rural areas. KOC is awesome and in the future I would love to get involved with them. If you like to know more click below.
