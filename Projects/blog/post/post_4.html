			<p id="post-text">Save The Children is a registered company founded in 1919 by Eglantyne Jebb and Dorothy Buxton. They are an international non-governmental organization that advocates children’s rights through better education, healthcare, economic opportunities, and providing emergency aid in natural disasters, wars, and other conflicts.</p>

My main focus of Save the Children is their take at children’s education at a global scale for developing countries. I gathered that they support education programs in classrooms and also at home. I learned that providing education goes beyond a classroom setting. You also have to think about children that can’t go to “school”, because they have to take on other responsibilities.
 Save The Children train teachers, coach parents and caregivers to help children learn at an earlier age so they are prepared to enter school. They offer ways to get kids to read or do math outside of school. Another thing that I like about Save The Children is that they introduce the arts to children. They don’t just focus on traditional education. They try to make sure children don’t stop learning due to a crisis, and try to help kids stay healthy so they can continue with their education. It makes me happy knowing that there is an established organization that is already tackling education at a global scale. There still needs more to be done. They are also helping the children with other problems they face. </p>
 <p id="post-text">
I strongly believe that education is very important, and Save The Children needs more knowledge about open-source education. I’m unaware how familiar they are with open source education. They have the capability to improve education in their education plan through open source education. 
Save the Children would benefit from partnering with other organizations like Kids On Computers. It would benefit children more. They do a lot of in print and physical teaching that if they open work more with open source resources children receiving an education would increase.
