				<h2>Save The Children<br><h3>April 4, 2017
</h3></h2><img src="../assets/media/kidbsave.jpg"> Save the Children is a registered company limited by guarantee founded in 1919 by Eglantyne Jebb and Dorothy Buxton. They are an international non-governmental organization that advocates children’s rights through better education, healthcare, economic opportunities, and providing emergency aid in natural disasters, wars, and other conflicts. My main focus of Save the Children is their attempt at children’s education at a global scale for developing countries. They support education programs in classrooms and at home. They train teachers, coach parents and caregivers to help the children learn early so they are prepared to enter school. They offer ways to get kids to read or do math outside of school. They introduce the arts to children to express themselves and help them do better in school. They try to make sure children don’t stop learning due to a crisis, and try to help kids stay healthy so they can continue with their education. I look up to Save the Children, because they are doing what they can with the resources that are available to them. I just think that they need to be doing more. I commend what they are doing to help the children not just with education but with other aspects they face. I strongly believe that education is very important, and Save the Children needs more knowledge about open-source education. I’m unaware if they are open to implementing open-source education in their education plan. Save the Children would benefit from partnering with other organizations like Kids on Computers to give the children more. They do a lot of in print and physical teaching that if they could open up their circle they could expand the education of many Children. You can help Save the Children by donating.
