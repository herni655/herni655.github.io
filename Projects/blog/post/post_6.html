				<h2>Open Culture<br><h3>April 7, 2017
</h3></h2><img src="../assets/media/open-c.jpg"> Today I came upon more of an online tool resources for open-source educational material. It is called Open Culture which aims to bring “high-quality cultural and educational media for the worldwide lifelong learning community.” Resources are available for K-12 students, parents, and teachers. They have free video lessons, tutorials, test prep materials, courses, movies, language lessons, art, images, and music. They also offer writing tips, lectures, and recordings. Resources are all accessible and organized to find material more easily. They have organized material into audio books, online courses, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), movies, languages, textbooks, and eBooks. They have also archive material and categorize media into categories. Open Culture realized that open-source material was not easy to find because it is scattered all over the web. For them they want to curate the content making it easier for you or anyone to find good resources. Open Culture was founded in 2006 by Dan Colman, Colin Marshall, Josh Jones, Mike Springer, Ayun Halliday, and Eric Oberle. Open Culture’s layout is very simple and a work in progress. You have to look around to find what they offer. It can be a little bit overwhelming, but overall a good tool. This is a great resource of resources. I think Open Culture is a great idea of brining open-source educational resources into one page. It makes it easier for students to find what they are looking for. It comes in handy in all sorts of educational environments because it offers knowledge on nearly about everything. I can see myself exploring this website because there are lots of sources that are free. You can help support Open Culture by monetary donation. Open Culture can be followed on Twitter, and Facebook. You can subscribe to receive regular updates. If you want to take a look, click the link.
