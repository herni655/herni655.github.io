				<h2>Phoenicia<br><h3>
</h3></h2><img src="../assets/media/pho.png"><p>Due to technology there are many possibilities in creating apps that are very useful. Through my research I came upon Phoenicia which is an Android app produced for the Learning XPRICE Competition. It is aimed at literacy. The creator Michael Hall focuses a lot on beta testing. He wants to keep improving his app and achieves it through testing and retesting. He understands the importance of open source education. His own son was diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder which encouraged him to developed Qimo which uses Ubuntu ISO in a personalized way for a simple interface for children with learning or developing disabilities. His son overgrew it and no Qimo is no longer available. Instead he and his wife are further developing Phoenicia. It is written “in Java, using the AndEngine game engine that provides a light layer on top of OpenGL (Open Source).” It is open source from the beginning, because they believe that testing makes their app better. They hope to get it available into multiple languages to reach more children. Therefor, increase the amount of children available to get it. Hall is expecting to develop Phoenicia and other projects in the future that are education and open source. I’m inspired by Hall. He used his own experience into developing Qimo, and in the process helped more children than he anticipated. It’s also pretty amazing that he continues to strive for open source education.
