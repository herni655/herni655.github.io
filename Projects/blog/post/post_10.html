				<h2>Lara<br><h3>April 17, 2017
</h3></h2><img src="../assets/media/lara-game.png"> It’s interesting how diving into more research on open-source education some post begin to connect. In this post I came upon Lara, a team who is entering the Learning XPRIZE completion, and wants to do more. They want to create an educational app for children that don’t have access to schools. Aiming for it to be available everywhere, and hope to extend their app to multiple languages. In trying to reach this, Lara wants passionate people to be engaged in the project. It’s awesome that they are thinking about language, because it is a very important role. Lara is at the beginning stage of their solution. In their first phase they want to target children in rural East Africa, focusing on the basics of reading, writing, and math (). The app would run on Android tablets and phones. Lara knows that their target are children who don’t have access to the internet, and can have bad eyesight. Their design is to make it simple and clear. They also want to emphasize sanitation, hygiene, and security, so it’s included in their digital stories (). They want to encourage collaboration outside the tablet. They want to use the advantages of the technology to achieve their goal. By using the camera, speakers, and voice recording they want to stimulate discussion by making content relevant, and asking open-ended questions (). I’m excited to see what Lara achieves. It’s awesome to get to see what a team for the Learning XPRIZE completion is thinking about tackling the competition. Lara is a non-profit organization based in Sweden, with an international composition and network. In order for the app to get to children in need, Lara plans to partner with organizations working close to the children in need. They want to make the app able to download to low-end smartphones. “The first versions of the app are in Swahili and English, and we already have plans to extend to more cultures and languages.” It’s pretty great to see the development of Lara. I can’t wait for more. If you’ve like to learn more about Lara, click on the link.
