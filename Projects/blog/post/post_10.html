			<p id="post-text">It’s fascinating how diving into more research post begin to connect to each other. In this post I came upon L:ara, a team who is entering the Learning XPRIZE completion. L:ara is a non-profit organization based in Sweden, with an international composition and network.</p>
			<p id="post-text">
They want to create an educational app for children that don’t have access to schools. Aiming for it to be available everywhere, and they hope to extend their app into multiple languages. “The first versions of the app are in Swahili and English, and we already have plans to extend to more cultures and languages. (L:ara)”</p>
<p id="post-text">
 In order for the app to reach the children in need, L:ara plans to partner with organizations working close to the children in need. They want to make the app available as a download to low-end smartphones. L:ara is thinking about the user and what is available to them at this point. I think that is passion, and it’s admirable to see. </p>
 <p id="post-text">
In trying to achieve their goals, Lara wants passionate people to be engaged in the project. It’s awesome that they are thinking about language, because plays a very important role in a child’s education. </p>

Lara is at the beginning stage of their solution. In their first phase they want to target children in rural East Africa, focusing on the basics of reading, writing, and math. The app would run on Android tablets and phones. 
L:ara knows that their target are children who don’t have access to the internet, and could have bad eyesight. They are thinking more about the initial problem and going beyond by thinking about design. It doesn’t stop there they also want to emphasize sanitation, hygiene, and security, so they included digital stories in their app. </p>
<p id="post-text">
They also want to encourage collaboration outside the tablet. In doing so they want to use the advantages of technology to achieve that goal. By using the camera, speakers, and voice recording they want to stimulate discussion by making content relevant, and asking open-ended questions. 
I’m excited to see what L:ara achieves. It’s awesome to get to see what a team for the Learning XPRIZE completion is thinking about tackling the competition. It’s pretty great to see the development of L:ara. I can’t wait for more. If you’ve like to learn more about L:ara, click below.
