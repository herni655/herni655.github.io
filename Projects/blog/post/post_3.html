			<p id="post-text">Learning more about what is available through open source education I noticed that more effort should be aimed at teachers. They are the first people in a student’s education who have a major influential in their education. That is why there are open-source programs designed for teachers. By giving teachers more accessible resources they can make an impact on their student’s education easier. </p>
<p id="post-text">			
Recently, I read a short excerpt about how Open Up Resources and El Education partner up to create accessible resources for teachers. They developed a free K-5 English Language Arts (ELA) program which can be used reached digitally or in print. It is a year-long curriculum that builds on a curriculum El Education produced in 2012. The program includes hand-on activities and lessons from popular texts. It will be available for the 2017-2018 school year. In order to understand more about these great companies, I did more research. 
Open up Resources began as a Collaborative K-12 for Open Educational Resources(OER). Which is a 13-state attempt to fill gaps in the curriculum market. They provide their curriculum to districts at no cost by publishing them as Open Educational Resources.  They use experts, check the guidelines, adapt to how it reacts in the classroom, and release as OER. They area able to release their material free due to philanthropic support. </p>
<p id="post-text">
El Education(EL) began as a collaboration between The Harvard Graduate School of Education and Outward Bound USA. They aim to create classrooms with the needed resources for teachers in order to give students the best resources to achieve greatness. They focus on student’s mastery of knowledge and skills, character, and high-quality student work. EL partners with schools, and organizations with similar ideals to bring forth their vision of student achievement. 
Organizations like Open Up Resources and El Education are crucial for students to receive the best open source resource. Their accessibility helps more teachers and students receive a better education not just in one area, but around the country. The possibility is more. For more click below.
