			<p id="post-text">Continuing exploring open source education I came upon an article that talks about MuseScore. It is different to the other post in that it’s targeted at a specific group, it is music related. I think that any program targeted at improving accessibility through open source is help to students. That is why I wrote about MuseScore.</p> 
			<p id="post-text">
MuseScore began as a 2002 hobby project from Werner Schweer, Nicolas Froment, and Thomas Bonte. Which is a company that is devoted to help aspiring musicians in mastering their love of music. It is a free easy-to-use music notation software that creates sheet music that works with Windows, macOS, and Linux.  
 It supports a wide variety of file formats and input methods. The great thing about MuseScore is that it’s free and open-source. The platform allows anyone to create, play, and print music. This is important when it comes to Education in Music. </p>
 <p id="post-text">
MuseScore has formed an online community where the community shares their work either privately or public by downloading, or embedding widgets, or using MuseScore’s mobile apps. 
An example of how MuseScore has affected learning is Alison Armstrong experience. She is a singer and music teacher at an international school in Laos. Through a course she took they recommended her to use MuseScore. In a interview she mainly talks about how she came across MuseScore and how she is implementing it in her teaching. The interview brief consists of how Alison saw a student use MuseScore and decided to download it. That’s how it started. Alison likes how MuseScore works across platforms. It is crucial because the use of MuseScore has more potential users. </p>
<p id="post-text">
She uses MuseScore to teach her students. It’s very interesting to see how MuseScore is directed at certain users, but has the potential to be used by anyone. That’s what is so great about open source. As well with seeing how MuseScore works, she wishes to see some improvements. The good thing is that since it’s open-source MuseScore has the ability to be improved. There is an API for third party developers on MuseScore.com. Meaning that you can alter MuseScores’ layout. MuseScore is changing how digital sheet music is being created, shared and used. It’s challenging how music education can be taught.
