				<h2>MuseScore<br><h3>March 13, 2017
</h3></h2><img src="../assets/media/musesc.jpg"> Continuing exploring open-source in education I came upon an article that talks about MuseScore. MuseScore began as a 2002 hobby project from Werner Schweer, Nicolas Froment, and Thomas Bonte. Which is a company that is devoted to help aspiring musicians in mastering their love of music. It is a free easy-to-use music notation software that creates sheet music that works with Windows, macOS, and Linux.   It supports a wide variety of file formats and input methods. The great thing about MuseScore is that it’s free and open-source. The platform allows anyone to create, play, and print music. This is important when it comes to Education in Music. They have formed an online community where the community shares their work, privacy or publicity, by downloading, embeddable widgets, or MuseScore’s mobile apps. A good example is Alison Armstrong who is a singer and music teacher at an international school in Laos. Through a course she took they recommended her to use MuseScore. There’s an interview that mainly talks about how she came across MuseScore, and how she is implementing that in her teaching. Here is the interview brief. Alison saw a student use MuseScore and decided to download it. Alison uses other soft wares like Sibelius but likes MuseScore because it works across platforms. She uses MuseScore to teach her students. It’s very interesting to see how MuseScore is directed at certain users, but has the potential to be anyone. That’s what great about open-source, and there is an API for third party developers on MuseScore.com. As well with seeing how MuseScore works, she wishes to see some improvements. The good thing is that since it’s open-source MuseScore has the ability to be improved. MuseScore is changing how digital sheet music is being created, shared and used. Here is the link to see the full interview.
