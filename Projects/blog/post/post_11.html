			<p id="post-text">Technology improves education in many ways. In the previous post I mostly focus on organizations, and in this post I want focus more on how technology used is benefiting the children. Through this process I came upon an article that talks about tablets as a platform.</p>
			<p id="post-text">
Technologies like tablets are a new platform to be explored as a learning resource. There are educational apps that can be downloaded on the tablets. That means that children all over the world can have access to it.  Within the apps children are able to learn about the world. They can connect with others, explore new ideas, and know what is going on within their country. There are many possibilities to what children can gain from technology. </p>
<p id="post-text">
Tablets take away excuses to why children can’t access learning. The only problem remaining then is how they are distributed to the children.
Tablets have the possibility to make learning possible at home if school is too far. The tablets contain levels of education, and children can learn at their own pace. Tablets are less expensive in the end. </p>
<p id="post-text">
Teacher’s don’t need to be trained and hired. No need for buildings or materials. Which can add up to a hefty cost. It might keep children out of prostitution, drugs, or war enrollment. If children have access to an education, they can gain knowledge that helps them lead better lives. It helps them get more opportunities. </p>
<p id="post-text">
Learning through technology also impacts the country as a whole. If a population is more educated the workfare is more effective, and adapted to international markets. </p>
<p id="post-text">
So yes! Technology has a big role in improving education. Just like there are pro there are also cons. Technology works better if it can access internet, but we continue to improve and not let us stop from pursing alternatives. As within some previous post, it is possible for content to be preinstalled. 
We just have to figure out more ways to make education available without the need of an internet connection. We can also start thinking of ways that we can get the internet available everywhere, which is a hard task.  The good thing is that we keep finding ways to improve education for children that don’t have access to resources. I think that is awesome. We continue to make a bigger effort in providing an equal education to children without resources. If you want to dive more in depth in ways technology is really good for learning, click below.
