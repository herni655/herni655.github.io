				<h2>Tablets As A Tool<br><h3>April 20, 2017
</h3></h2><img src="../assets/media/tab-kids.jpg"> Technology improves education in many ways. In these post I mostly focus on organizations, but in this post I want to know how the technology benefits the children. In my research I came upon an article that talks about this topic. Technologies like tablets ate a new platform to be explored as a learning resource. There are educational apps that can be downloaded. That means that children all over the world can have access to it.  Children are able to learn about the world. They can connect with others, explore new ideas, and know what is going on within their country. There are many possibilities to what children can gain from technology. It also gives no more excuses to why they can’t learn. For example, if school is far, with technology they can learn something within their home. They can make time if they have to work. There are levels to education, and through technology children can go at their own pace. It is less expensive in the end. Teacher’s don’t need to be trained and hired. No need for buildings or materials. Which can add up to a hefty cost. It might keep children out of prostitution, drugs, or war enrollment. If children have access to an education, they can gain knowledge that helps them lead better lives. It helps them get more opportunities. Learning through technology also impacts the country as a whole. If a population is more educated the workfare is more effective, and adapted to international markets (). So yes! Technology has a big effect in improving education. There is a flaw of learning with the use of technology. Which is the need for internet, but we continue to improve and not let us stop from pursing alternatives. As within some previous post, content can be preinstalled. We just have to figure out more ways to make education available without the need of an internet connection. We can also start thinking of ways that we can get the internet available everywhere, which is a hard task.  The good thing is that we keep finding ways to improve education for children that don’t have access to resources. I think that is awesome. If you want to dive more in depth in ways technology is really good for learning click on the link.
