			<p id="post-text">Learning Equality has a mission of providing a quality education to every person in the world through open educational resources, and facilitate their use inside and outside classrooms. In hopes of establishing a new educational model for all to succeed. I’m all in for their vision. It’s one of my favorite. They are trying really hard to provide education to 4.5 billion people. One of their biggest challenges is the lack of internet access. Learning Equality is not standing there and waiting for the internet to be accessed by all, because it will take time. They are going straight to the problem. There’s no time to waste. </p>

Learning Equality is using open educational resources, low cost computing, and sneakernet sharing (no internet access instead information is carried on portable devices) to accomplish their mission. They are thinking about devices their sources are going to be held in, empowering communities, and designing for everyone. I love how much though Learning Equality is giving to the problem of education. </p>
<p id="post-text">
They are using KA Lite which is an open-source platform that interacts with Khan Academy videos and exercises offline. Students just need access to the server over a laptop, tablet, computer, desktop. It can be installed directly on a learner’s computer. KA Lite is functioning in over 175 counties and territories. Learning Equality continues to develop applications for education. </p>
<p id="post-text">
They are working on Kolibri which is open-source that allows peer-to-peer sharing, and educational content all offline. Learning Equality is awesome! They want to combine a vast library of educational content from sources over the web, and make it available offline, on low cost devices. Kolibri heights the expected solution for open-source education to underprivileged kids.  
Learning Equality is making a big impact on the world. It is tackling a problem that they are aware of, and are not waiting for anyone else to solve it. I hope more and more people become aware. It will surely benefit the world. If you want to know more click below. </p>
