				<h2>Rumie Initiative<br><h3>April 7, 2017
</h3></h2><img src="../assets/media/rumie.jpg"> So, what else is being done to help the children of the world? Through my research an initiative called the Rumie Initiative strung my interest. It” is a not-for-profit organization brining free educational content to underserved communities through low-cost technology.” The Rumie Initiative and I can agree that education is a basic human right. I love that Rumie is tackling the problem of denied basic educational necessities. Rumie is saying goodbye to outdated resources and embracing technology. Rumie began in 2013 in Haiti with its open-source Android tablets which can be access without internet that contain educational material for elementary school students. Children’s progress can be tracked with analytic data provided by the tablet. That’s a great addition, because it points out if children are improving, or if they need help understanding the material. The tablets are low-cost. Costing less than the averaged textbook. That’s a win and awesome. They include lessons, videos, quizzes, and textbooks. The information that is included in the tablet’s is approximated to cost at least $5,000 in hard copy. Making the tablet a cheaper resource. Resources are available to students and teachers. I’m amazed how much fits into the tablet. Education should not have a price. Rumie is impacting many children’s lives. They have 5,000 tablets being used worldwide. In 21 countries including Syrian refugee camps in Jordan and Turkey, and in Indigenous communities in northern Ontario, Canada. I think it’s great that this initiative is having an impact in refugee camps and indigenous people. Rumie is an initiative that can be greater for a bigger impact. I have learned that in order for these types of initiatives to work communities must be willing. This is an amazing initiative and I wish more of this was taking place. If more people know the higher the chance at providing underprivileged kids with a competing education. If you want to take a look at Rumie Initiative, click the link.
