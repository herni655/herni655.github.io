			<p id="post-text">So, what else is being done to help the children of the world? Through my research an organization called The Rumie Initiative strung my interest. It is a not-for-profit organization brining free educational content to underserved communities through low-cost technology. The Rumie Initiative understands that education is a basic human right. I love that Rumie is tackling the problem of denied basic educational necessities. By saying goodbye Rumie is getting rid of outdated resources and embracing technology.</p> 
			<p id="post-text">
Rumie began in 2013 in Haiti with its open-source Android tablets which can be access without internet that contain educational material for elementary school students. Progress can be tracked with analytic data provided by the tablet. It’s a great addition, because it points out how users are improving. Which leads to understanding who needs help with the material. </p>
<p id="post-text">
The tablets are low-cost, costing less than the averaged textbook. That’s a win and awesome, because it is a big help to people that can barely afford a textbook. The tablets include lessons, videos, quizzes, and textbooks. The information that is included in the tablet’s is approximated to cost at least $5,000 in hard copy. Making the tablet a cheaper resource. </p>
<p id="post-text">
Resources are available to students and teachers. I’m amazed how much fits into the tablet. Education should not have a price. Rumie is impacting many children’s lives. They have at least 5,000 tablets being used worldwide. In 21 countries including Syrian refugee camps in Jordan and Turkey, and in Indigenous communities in northern Ontario, Canada. </p>
<p id="post-text">
I think it’s great that this initiative is having an impact in refugee camps and indigenous people. Rumie is an initiative that has the potential for a bigger impact. I have learned that in order for these types of initiatives to work communities must be willing to work with organizations. This refers back to the first post about Kids On Computers. They stated that when the community is involved they achieve so much more. 
This is an amazing initiative and I hope more of these kind of initiatives take place. If more people are made aware the higher the chance at providing underprivileged kids with a competing education. If you want to take a look at Rumie Initiative, click below.
