			<p id="post-text">In this post I’m diving into more detail about Learning Equality’s KA Lite and Kolibri. KA Lite is an offline version of Khan Academy. The other app that Learning Equality is using is Kolibri. It is an offline app for universal education.</p>
			<p id="post-text">
KA Lite mimics the online experience of Khan Academy. It is open-source software. It runs on the local server and you can watch Khan exercises, and track student progress without the use of an internet connection. There are over 7,000 videos and 20,000 interactive exercises. Instructional videos range from math, science, history, and economics. It can be used for personal, classroom, or school usage. Can be used at home schooling, on a road trip, a classroom in India, or correctional facility in Idaho. Amenities that are included in KA Lite are track performance, self-paced learning, individual feedback, and data syncing. Currently, KA Lite is offered in ten different languages with more being develop. Language is very crucial for children to understand material. I’m pleased to see that Learning Equality is taking in consideration a language barrier. </p>

Kolibri is an offline app for universal education. They want to make high quality ed-tech available to low-resource communities. That includes rural schools, refugee camps, after-school programs, and orphanages. A child’s location shouldn’t stop them from having the access to a good education. Kolibri requires no internet. It can be installed in devices and enable learners with a vast library of educational content. The way Kolibri works is by “seeding” a device. Once connected to the internet Kolibri installers updates, and content can be downloaded. This can be done once to access resources. In order for continuing with updates the device needs to be connected to the internet, but it can be distributed between devices. The “seeded” device has the ability to share new content and updates with other devices from an offline local network. A community must be willing as I stated before. That way in order to reach remote communities all you’ll need is a device that is carried by foot to share installation, content, and updates. </p>

These softwares are changing the way education can be accessible without an internet connection. It’s amazing to see what has been accomplished, and I can’t wait to see what continues to be developed. Click below for more.
