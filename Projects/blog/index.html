							<h2>	<a href="post/post_1.html">Kids On Computers</a></h2>
							<em>March 9th, 2017</em>
							<p>	
								Kids On Computers (KOC) is a non-profit all-volunteer organization. They set up computer labs in low-income schools using donated or new equipment bought through donations. The equipment contains free open source software and educational content that can be accessed without internet. KOC also sets up computer labs that can be used to teach software development, but their goal is aimed at teaching traditional academics.

							<h2><a href="post/post_2.html">MuseScore</a></h2>
							<em>March 13, 2017</em>
							<p>	
								Continuing exploring open source education I came upon an article that talks about MuseScore. It is different to the other post in that it’s targeted at a specific group, it is music related. I think that any program targeted at improving accessibility through open source is help to students. That is why I wrote about MuseScore.

							<em>April 3, 2017</em>
							<p>	
								LLearning more about what is available through open source education I noticed that more effort should be aimed at teachers. They are the first people in a student’s education who have a major influential in their education. That is why there are open-source programs designed for teachers. By giving teachers more accessible resources they can make an impact on their student’s education easier.

							<h2><a href="post/post_4.html">Save The Children </a></h2>
							<em>April 4, 2017</em>
							<p>	
								Save the Children is a registered company founded in 1919 by Eglantyne Jebb and Dorothy Buxton. They are an international non-governmental organization that advocates children’s rights through better education, healthcare, economic opportunities, and providing emergency aid in natural disasters, wars, and other conflicts.

							<h2><a href="post/post_5.html">Global Learning XPRICE Competition</a></h2>
							<em>April 6, 2017</em>
							<p>	
								Technology has a big impact on children’s education. Unfortunately, not every child will have access to it.  The amazing thing is that we continue to tackle this problem. I came upon the $15 million Global Learning XPRICE competition that is challenging teams “from all over the world to develop an open source scalable software solution that will enable children in developing countries to teach themselves basic reading, writing and arithmetic within the 18-month competition field-testing period(XPRICE).”

							<h2><a href="post/post_6.html">Open Culture</a></h2>
							<em>April 7, 2017</em>
							<p>	
								Today I came upon an online tool resources composed of open source educational material. It is called Open Culture which aims to bring “high-quality cultural and educational media for the worldwide lifelong learning community (Open Culture).” Resources are available for K-12 students, parents, and teachers. They have free video lessons, tutorials, test prep materials, courses, movies, language lessons, art, images, and music. They also offer writing tips, lectures, and recordings.

							<h2><a href="post/post_7.html">The Rumie Initiative</a></h2>
							<em>April 7, 2017</em>
							<p>	
								So, what else is being done to help the children of the world? Through my research an organization called The Rumie Initiative strung my interest. It is a not-for-profit organization brining free educational content to underserved communities through low-cost technology. The Rumie Initiative understands that education is a basic human right. I love that Rumie is tackling the problem of denied basic educational necessities. By saying goodbye Rumie is getting rid of outdated resources and embracing technology.

							<h2><a href="post/post_8.html">earning Equality</a>L </h2>
							<em>April 10, 2017</em>
							<p>	
								Learning Equality has a mission of providing a quality education to every person in the world through open educational resources, and facilitate their use inside and outside classrooms. In hopes of establishing a new educational model for all to succeed. I’m all in for their vision. It’s one of my favorite. They are trying really hard to provide education to 4.5 billion people. One of their biggest challenges is the lack of internet access. Learning Equality is not standing there and waiting for the internet to be accessed by all, because it will take time. They are going straight to the problem. There’s no time to waste.

							<h2><a href="post/post_9.html">KA Lite & Kolibri</a></h2>
							<em>April 11, 2017</em>
							<p>	
								In this post I’m diving into more detail about Learning Equality’s KA Lite and Kolibri. KA Lite is an offline version of Khan Academy. The other app that Learning Equality is using is Kolibri. It is an offline app for universal education.

							<h2><a href="post/post_10.html">L:ara</a></h2>
							<em>April 17, 2017</em>
							<p>	
								It’s fascinating how diving into more research post begin to connect to each other. In this post I came upon L:ara, a team who is entering the Learning XPRIZE completion. L:ara is a non-profit organization based in Sweden, with an international composition and network.

							<h2><a href="post/post_11.html">Tablets As A Tool</a></h2>
							<em>April 20, 2017</em>
							<p>	
								Technology improves education in many ways. In the previous post I mostly focus on organizations, and in this post I want focus more on how technology used is benefiting the children. Through this process I came upon an article that talks about tablets as a platform.

							<h2><a href="post/post_12.html">Phoenicia</a></h2>
							<em>May 8, 2017</em>
							<p>	
								Technology offers many possibilities in creating apps that are useful, it is something I have learned through this research. Through my research found Phoenicia, which is an Android app produced for the Learning XPRICE Competition. It is aimed at literacy. It’s so cool to see what another team competing for the same competition is doing. It provides a different perspective on how they are tackling the same problem.
