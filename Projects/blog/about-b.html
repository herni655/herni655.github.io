				<h1>About Blog</h1>
				<div class="about-sec">
				<p id="post-text2">My research started with the word accessibility. I was curious about the way programs allow for anyone to have the same resources without costing anything. In this case I questioned how can anybody specially students have access to resources and at the same time be affordable.</p>
				<p id="post-text2">
From this exploration I then moved to open source. Open source has the ability for anyone anywhere in the world have access to code or programs. Open source means that students can learn, alter layouts, and contribute to a community. It opens many doors that wouldn't be possible to reach without open source. </p>
<p id="post-text2">
This idea developed into creating a blog that showcases what is being done to help the underprivileged children, who don’t have the resources to get the best education they can. I’m passionate about this topic, because when I visit Mexico I realize that I am lucky to have a lot of resources within my school community, because that is not possible for everyone. I think that is a goal we have to strive for.</p>
</p>
<p id="post-text2">
Not everyone can get a great education. That is why I am interested in knowing what is being done. How can we continue to strive a need for children that aren’t lucky to have a computer, and the internet. I believe that education is very important in succeeding and having a chance at a better life. Through this blog I hope to highlight that education is a problem we have to face, and bring information to what is being done, as well as getting you involved.
