					<p>March 7, 2017 <br><br>My research started with accessibility. I was curious about the way everyone can have equal opportunities by having the same resources. In this case by having the accessibility to the internet and affordability to afford the same resources as someone of a higher class. This then moved to open source. Open source has the ability for people all over the world to gave access to code. This means they can learn, can alter the way something looks, and contribute to something everyone can have. By this I mean how can Adobe Suite not just be limited to the people that can afford it. How can it be made universal? Or produce something like it? How can people have the same resources at no cost or be affordable? I guess I question if it is possible, because that would be nice. I also realized that it is not just about having programs, books, or an open source platform that demands change. The change also needs to happen within communities. How can we bring the internet to them? How can we bring them the resources that they require in order to be able to compete in with everyone else? That I realize takes commitment, and money. Through my research I came upon Kids On Computers which is a non-profit organization that sets up computer labs where there is no access to computers or internet. They depend on contributions to accomplish their goal. When they set up the labs they bring computers that contain Wikipedia content, educational videos, and games. This allows the children to be able to access something that is crucial for education which is knowledge. It’s a bigger question of how it can be done? In order for this to succeed more people need to be made aware. Specially the country in which a community is in. The bad thing is that sometimes there’s not enough money that gets put into education that is equal for everyone. </p></div>

				<div class="para2"><p>Apart from being interested in affordability and accessibility for education, I think language is very 	interesting. How can language learning or language understanding when communicating with people of a different language be 		made easier? More universal? As I look into social media there’s videos of products that claim to help you understand 		someone speaking a different language. How close are we, and how is it possible?</p></div>

					On my first paragraph I mention Kids On Computers. I would like to go deeper to what they do and who they are. It is an all-volunteer organization registered in Colorado since 2009 as a nonprofit organization. They set computer labs in low-income schools using donated or new equipment. The equipment as I mentioned contains free open source software and educational content that can be accessed without internet. The labs can be used to teach software development, but their use is aimed at teaching. Kids On Computers receive cash donations which helps them purchase equipment. They are partnered with Linux Foundation and Choice Humanitarian. They receive support from Yahoo, HP, and others. They are always looking for volunteers. Kids On Computers has 20 current labs in Argentina, Cambodia, India, Mexico and Nepal. On their website you can learn more about each lab in that country.

					Continuing exploring open-source in education I came upon an article that talks about MuseScore. Which is a free score writer that works with Windows, macOS, and Linux.   It supports a wide variety of file formats and input methods. The great thing about MuseScore is that it’s free and open-source. The platform allows anyone to create, play, and print music. This is important when it comes to Education in Music. For example, Alison Armstrong is a singer and music teacher at an international school in Laos. Through a course they recommended her to use MuseScore. There’s an interview that mainly talks about how she came across MuseScore, and how she is implementing that in her teaching. Here is the interview brief. Alison saw a student use MuseScore and decided to download it. Alison uses other soft wares like Sibelius but likes MuseScore because it works across platforms. She uses MuseScore to teach her students. It’s very interesting to see how MuseScore is directed at certain users, but has the potential to be anyone. That’s what great about open-source. As well with seeing how MuseScore works, she wishes to see some improvements. The good thing is that since it’s open-source the ability to get it improve is higher. Here is the link to see the full interview. <a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/3/techmuse-music-alison-armstrong">MuseScore</a></p>
