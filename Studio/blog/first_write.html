				<p>My research started with accessibility. I was curious about the way everyone can have equal opportunities by having the same resources. In this case by having the accessibility to the internet and affordability to afford the same resources as someone of a higher class. This then moved to open source. Open source has the ability for people all over the world to gave access to code. This means they can learn, can alter the way something looks, and contribute to something everyone can have. By this I mean how can Adobe Suite not just be limited to the people that can afford it. How can it be made universal? Or produce something like it? How can people have the same resources at no cost or be affordable? I guess I question if it is possible, because that would be nice. I also realized that it is not just about having programs, books, or an open source platform that demands change. The change also needs to happen within communities. How can we bring the internet to them? How can we bring them the resources that they require in order to be able to compete in with everyone else? That I realize takes commitment, and money. Through my research I came upon Kids On Computers which is a non-profit organization that sets up computer labs where there is no access to computers or internet. They depend on contributions to accomplish their goal. When they set up the labs they bring computers that contain Wikipedia content, educational videos, and games. This allows the children to be able to access something that is crucial for education which is knowledge. It’s a bigger question of how it can be done? In order for this to succeed more people need to be made aware. Specially the country in which a community is in. The bad thing is that sometimes there’s not enough money that gets put into education that is equal for everyone. </p></div>

				<div class="para2"><p>Apart from being interested in affordability and accessibility for education, I think language is very interesting. How can language learning or language understanding when communicating with people of a different language be made easier? More universal? As I look into social media there’s videos of products that claim to help you understand someone speaking a different language. How close are we, and how is it possible?</p></div>
