			<p>This is a wireframe that looks at how the website would look like in a iPhone. It starts with the user having three options. When they pick an option it takes them to the categories of that option. Then they get the options to their chosen snack. A random generator was added to the begging and category. Thinking of adding it to the options as well.</p>
