			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Irene Hernandez was born in New York, but grew up in Mexico. At the age of seven years old she moved to Pennsylvania, where the Amish and cows are the biggest attraction. Her need for a change led her to study at Parsons School of Design. There she studies communication design in hopes of becoming an art director. When sheâ€™s not studying Irene is working, watching Netflix, running, or eating.
